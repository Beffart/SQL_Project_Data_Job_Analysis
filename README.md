# Background  

This project was created to better understand the data analyst job market, identifying the highest-paying and most in-demand skills. The goal is to simplify the job search process by highlighting key trends.  

The dataset comes from Luke Barousse's [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql), offering valuable insights into job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.  


### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools Used  

To explore the data analyst job market, I leveraged several essential tools:  

- **SQL**: The core of my analysis, enabling me to query data and extract meaningful insights.  
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust database management system, ideal for handling job posting data.  
- **Visual Studio Code**: My preferred environment for writing and executing SQL queries.  
- **Git & GitHub**: Crucial for version control, collaboration, and sharing my SQL scripts and findings.  

# The Analysis  

Each SQL query in this project was designed to answer key questions about the data analyst job market. Here‚Äôs the structured approach I followed:  


### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs

To uncover the most lucrative opportunities, I filtered data analyst roles by average annual salary and location, prioritizing remote positions. This query pinpoints the top-paying opportunities in the field.  


```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
### Key Insights from the Top Data Analyst Jobs in 2023:

### 2. Skills for Top-Paying Jobs  

To identify the key skills required for the highest-paying roles, I joined job postings with skill data. This provides a clear view of what employers prioritize when offering top-tier salaries.  

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
```
